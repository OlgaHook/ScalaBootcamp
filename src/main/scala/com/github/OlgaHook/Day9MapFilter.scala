  //Second related idea is a Filter instead of mapping something we filter by some so called predicate some condition

  val myOddNumbers = numbers.filter(it => it % 2 == 1) //i check each item in numbers and see if divided by 2 it gives 1 in reminder

  //  val myOddNumbers = numbers.filter(it => false) //this would return nothing meaning empty Sequence

  //shorter syntax
  val evenNumbers = numbers.filter(_ % 2 == 0) //so same as saying _ => _ % 2 == 0, or n => n % 2 == 0
  println(evenNumbers.toSeq)

  //so in effect filter uses a mapped array of truth values to select which item to keep
  val myOddTruths = numbers.map(it => it % 2 == 1)
  println(myOddTruths.toSeq)

  //we can create more complex filters
  def complexFilter(n: Int): Boolean = {
    //lots of complicated calculations perhaps

  val myNewValues = numbers.filter(_ % 4 == 0).map(_ + 100).map(_ * 8) //I could keep adding maps and filters
  println(myNewValues.toSeq)

  val myNewValuesFromDifferentOrder = numbers.map(_ + 100).map(_ * 8).filter(_ % 4 == 0) //here filter is useless
